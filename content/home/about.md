# Biography

Mohamed Saad Ibn Seddik is a postdoctoral associate at MIT Mechanical Engineering Department.
His research interests include  Interval Analysis, Autonomous Vehicles, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, and Robotics Software.

He has a obtained his MSc. in 2012 from ENSTA Bretagne in Computer Science and Automation for Embedded Systems.
In the same year, he obtained another MSc. from the University of Angers in Signal Processing and Dynamic Systems.
After graduation, he worked for the Oil and Gas Exploration company CGG that later funded his Industrial Ph.D.
His Ph.D. thesis is about using Interval Analysis for Underwater Localization for a large fleet of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles.
Interval Analysis is particularly efficient to solve inverse problems that are non-linear and non-Bayesian.
